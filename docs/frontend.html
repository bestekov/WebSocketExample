		<h1 id="main">Building and using the Windows Frontend</h1>
		<p>
			The Windows Frontend is written in C# using Visual Studio 2019. It is a
			WinForms Application rather than a WPF Application. I typically write my
			Desktop Applications in WinForms rather than WPF as I can quickly build
			the UI the way I want it to look and behave. I have messed around with
			WPF but just have not gotten the hang of it. It is something on my list of
			things to learn.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this sample application, I did learn about globalization and
			localization. Although this application is a good example of one way to
			accomplish localization, I will not go into details on this as it is not
			the focus of this project. If you are a native speaker of German, Spanish,
			or Lao, please update the localization files as I used
			<a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> to create the
			entries in the following resource files. I'm sure the localized text is
			nonsense.

				<li>WebSocketExample\Frontend\TeelSys.Web\WsClient.de.resx</li>
				<li>WebSocketExample\Frontend\TeelSys.Web\WsClient.es.resx</li>
				<li>WebSocketExample\Frontend\TeelSys.Web\WsClient.lo.resx</li>

				<li>WebSocketExample\Frontend\WebSocketExample\Form1.lo.resx</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2>Hardware and Software used</h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Raspberry Pi setup with the chat backend. (See the
					<a href="./backend.html">backend page</a> for details.)
				</li>
				<li>
					Windows PC
					<ul>
						<li>OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>
						<li>Visual Studio 2019</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h2>Code - The Visual Studio Solution</h2>
		<p>
			The Visual Studio Solution contains several projects. There is much more
			included in this project than what is required to exchange information
			with a WebSocket server. The TeelSys.Web.WsClient class is the heart of
			the example and is the one to focus on for implementing a Web Socket
			client in a C# application.
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>TeelSys.Globalization</strong> - Provides classes to assist
					with Localization of text displayed to the end users.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>LocalizedResourceHelper</u> - Static class to get localized
							text from resource files.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>TeelSys.Settings</strong> - Provides classes to allow the
					application to save and load settings. With the use of this library
					it is not necessary to retype the Server IP Address and Port each
					time the application is launched.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>AssemblyDetails</u> - Structure to hold information about the
							application such as Company, Copywrite, Description, Name, Title,
							and Version.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>AssemblyInformation</u> - Static Class with one static method
							to gets the application information and return it as an
							AssemblyDetails structure.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>SettingFileTypes</u> - An enumeration to indicate the type
							of setting file as either Application or User.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>SettingsEventActions</u> - An enumeration to indicate if an
							event is a load or save event.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>SettingsEventArgs</u> - An event arguments class to be used
							by the settings events being handled by the application.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>SettingsHandler</u> - A class to provide methods for loading,
							saving, and deleting settings files.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>WindowSettings</u> - Class for saving the position and size of
							the Windows Form.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>TeelSys.Web</strong> - Library which provides classes for
					working with web-based resources.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>ConnectionStateChangedEventArgs</u> - An event arguments
							class to be used when handling events being raised when a web
							class's connection state changes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>ErrorEventArgs</u> - An event arguments class to be used when
							handling events being raised when an error is raised within a web
							class.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>MessageReceivedEventArgs</u> - An event arguments class to
							used to be used when handling message received events being raised
							within a web class.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>WebContent</u> - Class to be used to request content from a
							web application such as a web page.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>WebHelper</u> - A Static Class with a method for building a
							URL from separate strings.
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>WsClient</u> - Used to send and receive messages to and from a
							WebSocket server. (This is the important class in this example.)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>WebSocketExample</strong> - The WinForms project which
					provides the User Interface.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<u>Form1</u> - The User Interface
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>Program</u> - The entry point for the application
						</li>
						<li>
							<u>UserSettings</u> - A class to hold the settings for the
							application with the ability to load and save the settings.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Using the Application</h2>
		<p>
			Once you have compiled the code, you may run the application. Below are
			some screenshots showing the application in use.
		</p>

		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					When you launch the application, enter the IP Address and port for
					the chat server, then click the "Connect" button.<br />
					<img src="images/frontend/WinForm_01.png"
		        alt="WinSocket Example Windows Application" />
				</li>
				<li>
					You will see a message in the message log stating that the application
					connected or an error if the connection could not be established.<br />
					<img src="images/frontend/WinForm_02.png"
		        alt="WinSocket Example Windows Application - Connected" />
				</li>
				<li>
					In order to send and receive messages, you need to have a second
					chat client running such as a web browser connected to the chat
					test page. When you tyoe a message and click the "Send" button,
					The message will be displayed in the Message Log of the Windows
					application or in a pop-up in the webpage.<br />

					<img src="images/frontend/WinForm_04.png" class="previewImage"
		        alt="WinSocket Example Windows Application - Sent Chat Message" /><br />
				</li>
				<li>
					When connected, you may click the "Disconnect" button in the Windows
					application to disconnect from the server.<br />
